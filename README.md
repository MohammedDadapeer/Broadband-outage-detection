# Broadband-outage-detection
India is seeing an explosion of new competitors in the Broadband space. 'India Broadband' is a company that is now seeing a lot of customer churn due to customer dissatisfaction because of broadband outages.  The company has now curated a dataset, where it tracks several variables that it believes impact the outage_duration. They have tracked three different outage durations, 0 for no outage, 1 for short outages that last anywhere between a few minutes and a maximum of 2 hours, and 2 for long outages that can last from 2 hours to sometimes even a couple of days.
